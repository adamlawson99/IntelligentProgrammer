Welcome to the intelligent programmer blog! My name is Adam Lawson and I'm the author of the blog. I'm a university student whose goal is to make programming make sense. I will be posting guides and write ups on topics I find interesting, from beginner to advanced. I will try to post 2-3 times a week and keep the content for my readers! Please visit my portfolio [here](https://adamlawson99.github.io/) or find me at any of the social media sites listed below.
